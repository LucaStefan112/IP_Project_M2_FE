# MedConnect
This repository contains a front-end application built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript, designed to streamline the process of scheduling medical appointments for patients. The app allows patients to easily schedule appointments with doctors, making the entire process faster and more efficient. Additionally, patients can upload their medical analyses, enabling doctors to review them prior to the appointment.

**Features**

Appointment Scheduling: Patients can view the available time slots and schedule appointments with their preferred doctors. The app provides an intuitive interface for selecting dates, times, and doctors.

Medical Analysis Upload: Patients have the option to upload their medical analyses, such as lab results or imaging reports, to the app. This feature enables doctors to review the analyses prior to the appointment, leading to more informed discussions during the consultation.

User-friendly Interface: The app is designed with a user-friendly interface, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience for patients when scheduling appointments and uploading analyses.

**Technologies Used**

The app is built using the following technologies:

Next.js: Next.js is a React framework that allows for server-side rendering, providing fast and optimized performance for the app.

Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a wide range of pre-designed components and styles, enabling rapid and consistent UI development.

TypeScript: TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that brings type-checking capabilities to the application. It enhances code quality and improves developer productivity by catching errors at compile-time.

API Calls: The app makes API calls to a server in order to retrieve and send data. The server handles the back-end logic and communicates with a database to manage appointments and analyses.
